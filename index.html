                            We here at Smash Studios have made it our goal to create a simplified platform fighter that <i>anyone</i> can pick up and have fun immediately.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you ever played smash before, you know that it can take years to become the least bit proficient at it. This immediate barrier can be intimidating for newer players and can make it very hard to play. In Smash Town, we have simplified many of the mechanics removed other's entirely.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                    Hey everyone, I go by Impact Lizard. I dabble in a variety of things. I've been messing around in Unity and trying to make games for about 3 years now. I also picked up pixel art recently, and I love making the pixel art for Smash Town.

                    Yo. I'm Benjamin, I go by <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lewiswolflord">Lewis</a> to the music world, and I made the Smash Town soundtrack. To make the music for this soundtrack, I used a program called Ableton and I took heavy inspiration from popular video game titles from the 80s.
