                        <h1>An Fun Approachable Platform Fighter For Everyone</h1>
                        <p>
                            Welcome! I am <a href="http://google.com">ImpactLizard</a>, the manager of this school project. Smash is and will always be one of my most loved game series. We here at Smash Studios have made it our goal to create a simplified platform fighter that <i>anyone</i> can pick up and have fun immediately.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you ever played smash before, you know that it can take years to become the least bit proficient at it. This immediate barrier can be intimidating for newer players and can make it very hard to play. In Smash Town, we have simplified many of the mechanics removed other's entirely.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The game is in very early development right now, and doesn't have a playable version, but we certainly plan on releasing a beta later. If you want to try it out just click download and it will take you to our Github page were you can download the latest release  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Games mechanics are certainly subject to change, but here is what we are planning right now.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No ledges, and easier recovery! If you've played Smash, then you know of the pain of ledges and recovery. Sometimes you lose life just to bad recovery. Here in Smash Town we have homogenized good recovery for all characters.</li>
                            <li>No specials! To simplify the experience, we have taken out specials entirely. No more frantic spamming up air when you mean to press up special as you fall to your death. You'll still have an up tilt on the ground though.</li>
                            <li>No grabs!</li>
                            <li>No sheilds! In this game your only defense mechanism will be dodging</li>
                            <li>And of course Wavedashing!</li>
                        </ul>

                    Yo. I'm Benjamin, I go by <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lewiswolflord">Lewis</a> to the music world, and I made the Smash Town soundtrack. To make the music for this soundtrack, I used a program called Ableton and I took heavy inspiration from popular video game titles from the 80s.
