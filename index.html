					<h1>A Simple And Fun Platform Fighter For Everyone</h1>
					<p>
						Welcome! We are <a href="https://github.com/SmashTown265">Punch Studios</a>, we have all played the Super Smash Bros. series and understand how fun it can be, but it also can be hard to pick up. Here at Punch studios are goal is a make an simple, yet fun, approachable platform fighter that anyone can play!
					</p>
					<p>
                        Smash Town is a free to play PC Game that is designed to have a modern pixel art feel. We've definitely simplifed a lot from Super Smash Bros., so if you're coming from there you'll definitely notice a difference. But if not, the controls are still complex enough to do awesome tricks.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        "Explain the controls here." Also tell Mac users that they are using the wrong operating system and that those losers won't be able to play without drinking wine.
                    </p>

						Hello. I am Wesley, I'm the director and project manager for Smash Town. I am also responsible for the artist side of things. Super Smash Bros has and will forever be my favorite game, and I have always been inspired to create my own platform fighter. Now, with the help of the rest of the members of punch studio, I finally get to see my dream unfold.

						Yo. I'm Benjamin, I go by <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lewiswolflord">Lewis</a> to the music world, and I made the Smash Town soundtrack. To make the music for this soundtrack, I used a program called Ableton and I took heavy inspiration from popular video game titles from the 80s.

                        Hi, I am Joe. I was a programmer, am a programmer, and will always be a programmer. I code all day and code all, and as such, am infected with the deadly scope creep...CREEPY. Many times Wesley needed to keep me from implementing haxdashing and sticky walking. I still managed to put a few easter eggs in it without him knowing so have fun finding those!

                        Salutations, I am Marcos. I did stuff but I don't have time to explain because the person programming the webpage doesn't have a lot of time.
